Here are the features I think we should have. This is probably going to be a WIP so feel free to change this up.

#### List of features

---
1. Have a file repository
2. Have a simple UI
  - Web UI:
     The web UI should be the preferred interface for administrative tasks. This  
     should include anything like add/remove users/privileges and make new  
     directories or move file locations. The web UI should be able to access all  
     features of the service.
  - Navisworks Plugin UI:
     The plugin will be a little more rudimentary when compared to the web UI.  
     Here users are most likely the service end-user (non administrative) and
     will not need to move files or create new directories (may consider
     adding the new directory thing later, assume not for now). This UI should
     be focused on letting users quickly add and update files to the directory.
3. The interface should have to larger sub-sections.
  1. Regular models (.dwg, .ifc, etc.) or anything that would be considered a single  
     system. We can talk more about identifying these later.
  2. Merged Models which are models that are native to Navisworks which are either  
     pointer files (.nwf) or collections of other files converted to a native  
     filetype (.nwd).
4. Should be well documented. Hopefully the documents will be a WIP throughout the  
  project and we can look at it as it grows to make sure it all makes sense.

#### Prototype 1 Expectations

I need some help getting these together so look over what I put up above and we can
talk about it later.
